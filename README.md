# Personal Portfolio
This is a repository showcasing my projects that I have completed, either as my project, a contracted master's project or a contracted personal project.
For proprietary rights, I cannot publish any findings or results from my projects. For ongoing projects, I cannot publish any images either. For more information on my projects, please contact me personally. 


# AERODIMA
AERODIMA is my MSc. project. It is the study of the aerodynamics of a cheetah's tail and then the implementation of an aerodynamically drag inducing tail onto a wheeled robot to enable high speed manoeuvrability. My involvement with AERODIMA is the mechanical and electrical design, manufacture, and control of the robot, from open loop to fullstate feedback control. I have a undergraduate student helping me out with the telemetry with this project.  

# WILDPOSE
The Wildpose project is a fellow MSc's project looking at the 3D mapping of objects using a LIDAR and RGB camera. In this project, I was contracted to do the mechanical design and manufacture of a 2DOF tripod as well as enabling motorized zoom and focus capabilities to the RGB lense. 

# BALEKA
The Baleka project is a fellow MSc's project looking at the use of an external appendage to enable stability on a bipedal robot. In this project, I was contracted to do the mechanical design and organise the manufacture of a bipedal robot which was to improve on the previous design iteration and make it lighter, cheaper, and more powerful. 

# SSISA TACKLE SHIELD
The SSISA Tackle shield is a project that I am contracted to do in my personal capabilities. It is to design and create a prototype of a tackle shield that has built-in sensors and communications to nearby devices to share the data measured. This is to be used in conjunction with rugby fatigue studies taking place at the Sports Science Institute of South Africa. 

# SSISA TACKLE SENSOR
The SSISA tackle sensor project was my undergraduate project. This involved putting sensors inside a tackle simulator, located on the SSISA property, to be able to read values like Player Loading. This is designed to read values from the dummy being tackled, as opposed to the readings from the players tackling the dummy.
